## Setup
Install [node and npm](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04).

```
git clone https://github.com/areebbeigh/netsim-cli.git
cd netsim-cli
npm install
```

Once all dependencies are installed, you're ready to go: `npm run start`.

## Info
The project is divided into a "core" and a "cli". This is to allow for the possibility of a react based GUI using the same core.
